    "This is the third practical session and now we're going to get into more of the geography-specific technical details. While this topic may seem less-glamorous than something on analysis, it's possibly the most important one if we want to make sure our analyses are accurate. There are lots of opportunities for pitfalls and errors to creep into our work when we deal with coordinates. We will look at different geographic and projected coordinate reference systems. Then we will see how those are implemented with GeoPandas so that we can reproject GeoDataFrames.\n",

    "* Identify key projections for working with world and U.K.-based datasets\n",
