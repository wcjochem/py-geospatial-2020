One consequence of this is that `shapely` geometries assume a cartesian coordinate system, so we need to (again) be careful when we're working with a geographic coordinate system (i.e. latitude and longitude). We'll see how distance calculations work first with just simple geometries and then we'll return to GeoDataFrames and consider some options for measuring distances on the earth. "

    "This practical has focused on distances that are straight lines or at least direct routes. That's one way to consider distance, but it's not the way. In geography we often use things like **network** distance, measured alone roads or other routes that take into consideration the turns. There's also more to understand to distance than just spacing. It's important to consider the **effort** to move in a certain path. This ideas leads to using types of \"friction surface\" or weighted distances that could consider the terrain (hilly, flat, swampy, etc.) or mode of transport (walking, bicycle, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "It's also worth noting that there are other implemented distance metrics. We could be using tools from within `scipy.spatial.distance` to work with the point coordinates. That certainly can give us a few more options, but always remember the issues related to the coordiante reference system if you want to do that."
